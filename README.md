## INTRODUCTION
For this project, I analyzed the sales performance of a retail store. The aim of this project is to gather insights about top-selling products, regional performance, monthly sales trends and give results for better decision making. The dataset contains detailed information about orders, customer demographics, and sales.

## DATA EXPLORATION
### How was the data collected?
The data was provided by the sales team. It contains summarized customer information and sales details from 2023 to 2024. 

## TOOLS USED
For Data cleaning: 
Microsoft Excel

For Analysis:
Microsoft Excel and SQL 

For Visualization: 
PowerBI

## FEATURES IDENTIFIED FOR ANALYSIS
- Total sales by product, region, and month  
- Average sales per product
- Total units sold by product, region and month

## METHODOLOGY 
The dataset was loaded into Microsoft Excel. It was cleaned by addressing the blanks, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistent formats across the cells. Data was summarized by total sales, region, months using the Pivot tables. This gives us summarized information about the dataset. Further, the cleaned dataset was imported into SQL server to perform more analysis by querying the dataset. After obtaining satisfied results, the created views were imported into PowerBI for visualization.

## FINDINGS
It is discovered that Shoe product has the highest number of sales at $613,380, while Socks product has the lowest number of sales at $180,785. This makes Shoe the top-selling product and Socks the bottom-selling product. Although Shoe product has the highest sales, it does not have the highest number of units sold. The product with the highest number of units sold is Hat at 15,929 units.

February has the highest sales at $546,300 and the highest number of units sold at 9,930 while September has the lowest sales at $34,720.

Southern region beats other regions with the highest sales at $927,820 and also the region with the highest number of units sold at 24,298. The Western region has the lowest sales at $300,345 and lowest number of units sold at 11,400.


## RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. Shoe Product Performance
   
The Shoe product has the highest sales but does not have the highest number of units sold. This suggests that each unit of Shoe might have a higher price margin compared to other products.

To boost overall sales, I would suggest promotional campaigns that would highlight the Shoe product's premium nature. Also bundling Shoes with lower-priced items like Socks or Hats to drive more volume sales of the products.

### 2. Low Sales of Socks

Socks have the lowest sales, indicating that there might be a lack of demand or interest in this product. I would suggest conducting customer surveys to understand why Socks are underperforming.

Are they priced too high?

Is the product offering too limited or not appealing enough?

Special promotions or redesigning the product line might help. You could also look into cross-selling Socks with other higher-selling items like Hats or Shoes to drive more sales.

### 3. Leverage February's Strong Performance
   
February has the highest sales and the highest number of units sold. This indicates strong demand, perhaps tied to seasonal trends or specific marketing campaigns during that period. I recommend that analysis should be done to identify factors that contributed to February's success, such as promotions, holidays, or marketing campaigns. Use those insights to replicate these strategies in other months, particularly in the slower months like September. 

### 4.	September's Poor Performance
   
Investigate what may have caused this dip in sales. Is it a seasonal slowdown, lack of marketing efforts, or perhaps issues with product availability?
I recommend a flash sale or special promotion to spike interest in the month, or bundle products at a discount to encourage purchases.

### 5. Regional Insights for Targeted Marketing

The Southern region outperforms all others with the highest sales and the highest number of units sold. Conversely, the Western region has the lowest sales and the lowest number of units sold.

I recommend focused marketing efforts in the Southern region to further capitalize on its strong performance. An increase stock or targeted advertising campaigns would ensure that products that are in high demand there are not being understocked.

For the Western region, I suggest analyzing what might be causing lower sales. Is it a lack of product visibility, poor marketing, or logistical issues?
Perhaps localized marketing in this region could improve sales. Conduct a deeper dive into customer preferences in this region and competitor activity to better your approach.

### 6. Hat Product as a High-Volume Item

Hats have the highest number of units sold, even though they may not have the highest total sales.

Hats are clearly popular among customers, so there may be an opportunity to increase profitability by adjusting the pricing strategy or introducing variations. I would also suggest bulk sales or promotional offers tied to the high volume of units sold.
