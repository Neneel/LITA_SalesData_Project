## INTRODUCTION
For this project, I analyzed the sales performance of a retail store. The aim of this project is to gather insights about top-selling products, regional performance, monthly sales trends and give results for better decision making. The dataset contains detailed information about orders, customer demographics, and sales.

## DATA EXPLORATION
### How was the data collected?
The data was provided by the sales team. It contains summarized customer information and sales details from 2023 to 2024. 

## TOOLS USED
### For Data cleaning: 
Microsoft Excel

### For Analysis:
Microsoft Excel and SQL 

### For Visualization: 
PowerBI

## FEATURES IDENTIFIED FOR ANALYSIS
- Total sales by product, region, and month  
- Average sales per product
- Total units sold by product, region and month

## METHODOLOGY 
The dataset was loaded into Microsoft Excel. It was cleaned by addressing the blanks, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistent formats across the cells. Data was summarized by total sales, region, months using the Pivot tables. This gives us summarized information about the dataset. Further, the cleaned dataset was imported into SQL server to perform more analysis by querying the dataset. After obtaining satisfied results, the created views were imported into PowerBI for visualization.
